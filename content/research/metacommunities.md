> Community ecology is the study of how species interact with each other in ways
that determine patterns in the distributions and abundances of different species. It
represents the nexus at which individual traits, fitness, and population dynamics
scale up to influence the distribution and coexistence among species on local to
biogeographic scales and from months to millennia.

Life is in constant flux.
Although the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology are often partitioned as such, the reality is Earth's ecosystems are a function of

An ecological community is a set of different species that
compose an ecosystem at a given place and time.
One way to conceptualize a community is as a network of different species, some of which interact with one-another, and some of which don't.
