Ever since life originated on Earth, it has been in constant flux. Cells replace themselves, individual organisms are born and die, genomes evolve, species originate and go extinct,


Although the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology are often partitioned as such, the reality is that the composition of Earth's ecosystems has been and will continue to be in constant change.

Dispersal, selection, drift, mutation/speciation.

> Community ecology is the study of how species interact with each other in ways
that determine patterns in the distributions and abundances of different species. It
represents the nexus at which individual traits, fitness, and population dynamics
scale up to influence the distribution and coexistence among species on local to
biogeographic scales and from months to millennia.

An ecological community is often defined as the set of different species that
compose an ecosystem at a given place and time.
One way to conceptualize a community is as a network of different species, some of which interact with one-another, and some of which don't.
However, different species vary in their distribution across space.  



The crux of this project at the moment is
I build software to simulate metacommunity dynamics (MetacommunityDynamics.jl).
