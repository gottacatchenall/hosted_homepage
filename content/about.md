hiâ€”

I'm mdcatchen, and this is my website. I'm a graduate student in the [Gonzalez
Lab](http://gonzalezlab.weebly.com/) in the Department of Biology at [McGill
University](https://www.mcgill.ca/biology/).

I study ecology using computers, math, simulation models, etc.,

with the goals of understanding how humans are affecting Earth's biodiversity,
building software to forecast ecological systems, and designing landscapes that
best mitigate biodiversity loss and its impacts on humanity.

i also like blah blah blah.

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\alpha x}}$$
