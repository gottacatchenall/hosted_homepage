How is it that we know something is or is not true?
The short answer is: we can't.

The definition that knowledge is justified true belief is [itself flawed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem]).

Science at its heart is a methodology for determining whether a claim $x$ is true or not.

The are valid criticisms made of Popper's program,
yet the necessity that a theory makes a falsifiable claim necessitates that any valid theory must be _predictive_.

In this case model and theory are synonymous.

Then a model $f$ must take a set of inputs $x$ and make a prediction $y$, typically as a function of parameters $\theta$.

The difference between observed reality $\hat{y}$ and the model's prediction can be expressed as $\epsilon = |y - \hat{y}|$, where $\epsilon$ is attributed to measurement error. Measurement error
is an inescapable constraint on observation.

Naturally, given a set of competing theories to explain the same data, $f_1, f_2, \dots$, and corresponding measurement errors $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \dots$, a natural instinct would be to choose the model $f^\*$ with the lowest observed error, $e^\*$.
